What does the model achieve?
- This model shows the relationship between current and voltage given a specific resistance.
How should metrics be interpreted?
-This model should be interpreted by showing a linear relationship between current and voltage
What are appropriate use cases?
-This use case is specific to when using a specific resistance of R = 200
How is it implemented? 
- It s implemented by applying a specific current with a resistance to give a specific voltage v= r*c
It is okay to recognize limits of your expertise
-Yes, 
What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- Only valid for when a resistance of 200 ohmns is used.
How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
- This specific result shows a linear relationship between current and voltage, could be tested to see if it is valid given other resistances
